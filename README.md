## What are Design Tokens?
Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system â€” spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. â€” represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. Theyâ€™re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.
